        The Mail asked me to comment on that 8รท2(2+2) equation that&#39;s been doing the rounds.
        Didn't have a pen, so I took a reaaalllyy close up picture of my finger and scribbled on the photo to explain..

She shows us two different forms of original equation: `8/(2*(2+2))=1` and `(8/2)*(2+2)=16`.
Which one is correct?

So lets use [BODMAS] to get the true answer (1).

1. Do things in **Brackets** First: `8/2*(2+2) = 8/2*4`
2. Exponents (Powers, Roots) before Multiply, Divide, Add or Subtract: can't apply
3. Multiply or Divide before you Add or Subtract: can't decide
4. Otherwise just go **left to right**: `8/2*4 = 4*4 = 16`

So it looks very clear - **the answer is 16**.
