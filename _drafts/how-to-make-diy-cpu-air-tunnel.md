I needed air tunnel for my new Ryzen 3 2200G APU, I was doing a little research some time ago.
There was **any cheap air tunnel on the EU market** at this time.
Due to that I made it myself.
Do you wish to made it too?

## What do we need to prepare?

 * computer case with perforated side wall
 * old or broken fan
 * empty plastic bottle
 * knife
 * ruler
 * glue like thing

If the computer case has not perforated side, please don't make air tunnel.
In this case use tower cooler combined with rear exhaust fan.
(or use a force to remove some material from it)

## How to do it?

 1. **open the computer** case
 1. **measure distance** between top of the CPU coolers fan and the side wall
 1. **cut piece of bottle** in needed length
 1. carefully **extract the motor** with blades from old or broken fan
 1. **insert piece of bottle into fans frame** and temporary fix it together (f.e. by paper towel)
 1. try to mount it and **check if there is enough space** between it and coolers fan (f.e. 5mm)
 1. if the end of bottle touches or is nearly to touch cooler fan, short it
 1. **fix it** at position by glue like thing (f.e. by glue)
 1. you made it

Don't forget to check the position and length of the tunnel.

## How it works?

The package temperature **decreased from 76째C max / 73째C stable load to 72째C max / 68째C stable load**, which means less noise from cooler.
The boost frequency increased from 3693MHz max / 3393MHz stable load to 3693MHz max / 3418MHz stable load, which means nothing.
The main side effect of this cooling solution is **reduction of temperature of whole system**, not only the CPU temperature.
