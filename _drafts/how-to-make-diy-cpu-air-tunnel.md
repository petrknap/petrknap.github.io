I need air tunnel for my new Ryzen 3 2200G CPU and I did a little research some time ago.
There was any chap air tunnel on the EU market at this time, so I made it myself.
Do you made it too?

# What do we need to prepare?

 * computer case with perforated side wall
 * old or broken fan
 * empty plastic bottle
 * knife
 * ruler
 * glue like thing

If the computer case has not perforated side, please don't make air tunnel.
In this case use tower cooler combined with rear exhaust fan.
(or use a force to remove some material from it)

# How to do it?

 1. open the computer case
 1. measure distance between top of the CPU cooler fan and the side wall
 1. cut piece of bottle in needed length
 1. carefully extract the motor with blades from old or broken fan
 1. insert piece of bottle into fans frame and fix it together
 1. try to mount it and check if there is enough space between it and coolers fan (f.e. 5mm)
 1. if the end of bottle touches or is nearly to touch cooler fan, short it
 1. fix it at position
 1. you made it

# How it works?

The package temperature decreased from 76째C max / 73째C stable load to 72째C max / 68째C stable load, which means less noise from cooler.
The boost frequency increased from 3693MHz max / 3393MHz stable load to 3693MHz max / 3418 stable load, which means nothing.
The main side effect of this cooling solution is reducing temperature of whole system, not only the CPU temperature.
