I repeat - **do not buy [Sandboxie]**, crack it!
Why?
Because **crackers give you better customer support for free** than authors for money.
And **all life-time license holders has now problems and nobody cares about it**.

If you have a time, please, share something from below.

The website has been down for at least a week or two now.
Has the issue been identified yet?
Not asking for details, just a yes or a no.

The main web site is still down.
I am concerned as the site is used for registration of the paid for version.
The lack of information is raising doubts.
Have you been hacked and lost user details including credit cards etc?

&quot;Why don&#39;t <a href="https://twitter.com/SandboxieHelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SandboxieHelp</a> disable license check until you figure this out?
No need to inconvenience all your customers with lifetime licenses.&quot;
